## 💡 Why?

Meetings are expensive. Often unnecessarily so. Seeing "$487.23 and counting..." in big red numbers makes the point better than any memo.

Use this to:
- Justify meeting audits
- Push back on unnecessary meetings
- Add some accountability to meeting culture
- Have a laugh (or cry) at the cost of "quick syncs"
